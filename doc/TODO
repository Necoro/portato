- use alternative way of displaying categories (tree-like - see Porthole)
- move GUI prefs out of the system config

I would like to be able to see at a glance:
1. How many packages I have installed. (Hopefully in the menubar)
a. How many of the packages are installed, and the number there are in each category. (Just like you do with the queue: "x of y"::"installed of available")
