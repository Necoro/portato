List of hooks currently being supported by Portato
==================================================

emerge:
-------
Called: When emerge or every other command given by e.g. the synccmd preference is being called.
Parameters:
	- string[] packages: Packages to emerge (includes "world", "system").
	- string[] command: The exact command to execute.
	- portato.gui.wrapper.Console console: The console the output will be written to.
	- function(string) -> None title_update: Function which updates the console title in the GUIs.

Return if override: Nothing


after_emerge:
-------------
Called: When the emerge process (or other - see emerge hook) is finished. 
Parameters:
	- string[] packages: The list of cpv's (plus "world", "system") which have been emerged. (Or not if it failed.)
	- int retcode: The return code of the command.

Return if override: Nothing
Comment: This uses an extra hook as emerge is started in an extra thread and thus all plugins being wanting to come "after" will be called while emerge is still running.

open_ebuild:
------------
Called: When an ebuild window is opened.
Parameters:
	- portato.backend.Package package: The current package whose is going to be displayed.
	- Window parent: The parent window. Exact type depends on the frontend.

Return if override: Window-object which can be called by the frontends. Please see the explicit code to see what is expected.
Comment: If you want to override - do this only for ONE specific frontend.
