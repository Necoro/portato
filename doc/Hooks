List of hooks currently being supported by Portato
==================================================

emerge:
-------
Called: When emerge or every other command given by e.g. the synccmd preference is being called.
Parameters:
	- string[] packages: Packages to emerge (includes "world", "system").
	- string[] command: The exact command to execute.
	- vte.Console console: The console the output will be written to.
	- function(string) -> None title_update: Function which updates the console title in the GUIs.

after_emerge:
-------------
Called: When the emerge process (or other - see emerge hook) is finished. 
Parameters:
	- string[] packages: The list of cpv's (plus "world", "system") which have been emerged. (Or not if it failed.)
	- int retcode: The return code of the command.

Return if override: Nothing
Comment: This uses an extra hook as emerge is started in an extra thread and thus all plugins being wanting to come "after" will be called while emerge is still running.

main:
-----
Called: When the main routine is being entered. Everything in the application is done inside this main routine. Hooks connecting "after" will be run, when the application is shutdown.
Parameters: None
Return if override: Nothing

Comment: DO NOT OVERRIDE :)
